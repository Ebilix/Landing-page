# Landing-page
My second Odin project

This Landing-page project initially seems daunting, because I had to do everything, both HTML and CSS, from scratch. However, I was able to break even when I followed the guidelines and recommendations given in the project. I did the design section by section, starting from the top to bottom. Also, I wrote the HTML code first before styling in each of the section.

After I was able to do the first section to look very much like the given design, I was motiveted to push through the project to the end.

The project afforded me the opportunity to practice most of what I learnt in the HTML and CSS foundations course. With my ability to accomplishment this feat, I am greatly motivated to go through the program to the end!
